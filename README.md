# Sketching and Prototyping
Using the information in the results of Assignment 1 for what is good and bad about the UI for designed tasks, we are going to make **Sketches** and **Prototypes**. These sketches and prototypes will lead to better design in Assignment 3. The prototypes will be then tested through a usability evaluation followed by design revision in Assignment 4.

## Part A: Sketches

### 1. Scan/Photo of Sketches

### 2. Version Differences
#### 2.1 Solution for Problem 1
**Main Solution**
```
Because the user should know the change language feature fast, this feature must be placed at
an easy-to-see place. Top of the page is an ideal position.
```
**Alternate Solution A**
```
Other than easy-to-see position, one can place a fixed button on the left screen that can be clicked
to show the list of available languages.
```
**Alternate Solution B**
```
Just like the Alternate Solution A, but the button fixed into the bottom of screen.
```
#### 2.2 Solution for Problem 2
**Main Solution**
```
The size of the frame should be adjusted. Use a left-right arrow to iterate through the
object and show all objects below of the frame. (Both frame and objects are hyperlink) 
```
**Alternate Solution A**
```
All the objects (each object is hyperlink) are placed in a box and can be iterated using scroll.
```
**Alternate Solution B**
```
Similar to Main Solution, but don't show the objects below frame and make the frame's
size bigger.
```
#### 2.3 Solution for Problem 3
**Main Solution**
```
Instead of showing the new objects below the old objects, the "Load More" should hide or
erase the old objects from the screen and show the new objects.
```
**Alternate Solution A**
```
One can make a left-right arrow to iterate through the objects. The hidden object should
be erased from screen (to save memory) and the to-be-shown objects should be made.
```
**Alternate Solution B**
```
The page are divided into 2 part, The left part shows the detail of the object that's
clicked and the right part shows the list of objects available and can be iterated 
using scroll.
```

### 3. Selected Sketch
```
Please write a paragraph telling us about which design you picked for Parts B and C 
and why you selected it.
```

### 4. Design Rationale
```
Please write a paragraph expressing what you have learned from the contextual inquiry, 
and how it is reflected in your design.
```

## Part B: Assumptions
### 1. Hardware
```
Please write what are the assumptions for the hardware on which your new design will be implemented, 
such as: screen size, screen resolution, on touch screen, via physical buttons, 
using accelerometer/gyroscope, using mouse, keyboard, etc. 
Please be specific with the required hardware and any other assumptions, 
like whether the screen is color or black and white, etch.
```
### 2. Users
```
Please write down the assumptions about your users. 
What level of experience do you expect? 
Who familiar with computers/gadget will they be? 
What ages? 
Are there any other factors about the users that will influence your design?
```

## Part C: Prototypes
We will work on this part together during the class on **March 22nd, 2019**, 10:00 AM - 12.30 PM. Therefore, prior to the class please complete all the above parts (A & B) beforehand accordingly.
