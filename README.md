# Sketching and Prototyping
Using the information in the results of Assignment 1 for what is good and bad about the UI for designed tasks, we are going to make **Sketches** and **Prototypes**. These sketches and prototypes will lead to better design in Assignment 3. The prototypes will be then tested through a usability evaluation followed by design revision in Assignment 4.

## Part A: Sketches

### 1. Scan/Photo of Sketches

![part2](/img/p2.jpg)

![part3](/img/p3.jpg)

![part4](/img/p4.jpg)

#### Sketch using InVision

![part6](/img/lowfid_2.png)

![part7](/img/lowfid_3.png)

![part8](/img/lowfid_4.png)

**Note: Photo and InVision version of sketch have different numbering**

### 2. Version Differences
#### 2.1 Solution for Problem 1
**Main Solution**
```
Because the user should know the change language feature fast, this feature must be placed at
an easy-to-see place. Top of the page is an ideal position.
```
**Alternate Solution A**
```
Other than easy-to-see position, one can place a fixed button on the left screen that can be clicked
to show the list of available languages.
```
**Alternate Solution B**
```
Just like the Alternate Solution A, but the button fixed into the bottom of screen.
```
#### 2.2 Solution for Problem 2
**Main Solution**
```
The size of the frame should be adjusted. Use a left-right arrow to iterate through the
object and show all objects below of the frame. (Both frame and objects are hyperlink) 
```
**Alternate Solution A**
```
All the objects (each object is hyperlink) are placed in a box and can be iterated using scroll.
```
**Alternate Solution B**
```
Similar to Main Solution, but don't show the objects below frame and make the frame's
size bigger.
```
#### 2.3 Solution for Problem 3
**Main Solution**
```
Instead of showing the new objects below the old objects, the "Load More" should hide or
erase the old objects from the screen and show the new objects.
```
**Alternate Solution A**
```
One can make a left-right arrow to iterate through the objects. The hidden object should
be erased from screen (to save memory) and the to-be-shown objects should be made.
```
**Alternate Solution B**
```
The page are divided into 2 part, The left part shows the detail of the object that's
clicked and the right part shows the list of objects available and can be iterated 
using scroll.
```

### 3. Selected Sketch
```
For the problem 1, the writer choose the Main Solution because it's mandatory for an
important feature like changing language is visible from the start when user open the page

For the problem 2, the writer also choose the Main Solution. The reason for selection
because a highlighted object should be shown bigger to emphasize it. Another reason because
it's easier to see other highlighted objects.

For the problem 3, the writer choose Alternate Solution A because of it simplicity to
iterate through objects only using click.
```

### 4. Design Rationale
```
The sketch and its selection are made by making oneself seeing the problem from the
perspective without minding advanced techniques one know. Using this method, one will know
what's wrong with the interface and what should one do to make it better.
```

## Part B: Assumptions
### 1. Hardware
```
1. Computer with minimum requirement: Intel Dual-Core@2GHz Intel HD Graphic 2GB RAM
or Android Lolipop 1GB RAM
2. Screen size: 15.6 inch
3. Screen resolution: higher than or equal to 960x720 and ratio 4:3
4. Using physical buttons or touch screen
```

### 2. Users
```
1. Familiar with using computer/android and web browser
2. The user range from 8-60 years old
```
